Hi,

My name is Julian Jenkins and I am a current senior at College of the Holy Cross. I am a Computer Science Major and Statistics Minor while being a Varsity 
Athlete on the Division 1 Men's Lacrosse Team. These projects are programs I have built in class or at-home and I feel are good to include in my portfolio. Descriptions
for them are included in my resume.
